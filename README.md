# AirBnB_clone

Created By: Christian Williams and William Dyrland-Marquis

<h2>Description:</h2>
    We collaborated to create a console that we can use to access and manipulate objects
    that we created that store data. This was part 1 of our AirBnB clone Project.

<h2>Install/Usage:</h2>
    You can install and personally try our console by cloneing our repo and executing the console from the index 
    directory.
    
    ./console
    
<h3>Example #1:</h3>
    
    (hbnb) help
        
    Documented commands (type help <topic>):
    ========================================
    EOF  all  create  destroy  help  quit  show  update
    
<h3>Example #2</h3>

    (hbnb) create BaseModel
    6edcf566-c643-453d-856c-64253c7578d0
    (hbnb) show BaseModel 6edcf566-c643-453d-856c-64253c7578d0
    [BaseModel] (6edcf566-c643-453d-856c-64253c7578d0) {'id': '6edcf566-c643-453d-856c-64253c7578d0', 'created_at':     datetime.datetime(2019, 11, 18, 0, 39, 5, 103170), 'updated_at': datetime.datetime(2019, 11, 18, 0, 39, 5,         103203)}
    (hbnb) quit

<h2>Struggles</h2>
    Console Issues: at one point it completely stopped working.
    Though hard work and dilligence we were eventually able to figure it out and have it working once more.
    It was intresting to learn about the consol and how it fits in the stack, it was pleasently challanging.
